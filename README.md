COMP30016 Part A Tester
================

This is a series of test cases for COMP30016 - Computer Science Project by Shaanan Cohney

They apply to the course game for Semester 2 2013 - 'Jumper'

A series of game boards to test have been provided in tests/ with results in numerical order in test/out.txt

They have as of yet, not been verified by anyone else but I encourage you to run your code on them and provide feedback/update test cases.

Update 12:12AM Wed 21 Aug - Replaced All Test Boards
