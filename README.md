This is a series of test cases for COMP30016 - Computer Science Project by Shaanan Cohney
They apply to the course game for Semester 2 2013 - 'Jumper'

They have as of yet, not been verified by anyone else but I encourage you to run your code on them and provide feedback/update test cases.
WARNING: I have not yet tested my counting code properly so it may well be that most of the results are off. This is intended as a collaborative effort.
