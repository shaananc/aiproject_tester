COMP30016 Part A Tester
================

This is a series of test cases for COMP30016 - Computer Science Project by Shaanan Cohney

They apply to the course game for Semester 2 2013 - 'Jumper'

A series of game boards to test have been provided in tests/ with results in numerical order in test/out.txt

They have as of yet, not been verified by anyone else but I encourage you to run your code on them and provide feedback/update test cases.
### WARNING: I have not yet tested my counting code properly so it may well be that most of the results are off. This is intended as a collaborative effort.
